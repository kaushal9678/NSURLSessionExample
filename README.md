# NSURLSessionExample
This example shows how to use NSURLSession for API in a batch processing way.
I create a class KYURLSessionOperations class in which I create two types of methods 
 * one is for request type 
 * and another one is simple just pass url and fetch data.
 
 and in ViewControllor class allocate that class instance and add it to queue.
